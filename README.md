# Java Spring API
### This API can be used as a admin panel page to add, remove, update users and ID's. 
The API runs on localhost:8080 and the database can be changed, for the perpuse
of this API I used fake ID's and Names.

## ScreenShots
Note: I used Postman to make all the calls in the screenshots.
